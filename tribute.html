        <h2>Tribute: The Bible for Normal People </h2>
        <p>Normal might be a leap. But questioning the paradigms and dogmas that so many religions have clinged to for, literally,
            thousands of years is also a leap. Luckily, we don't have to take that leap alone, and we don't have to do so without
            knowing whats around us.
        </p>
        <p>Almost everyone has heard of the Bible, and if you live in America, you've probably been told to read it. You were
            also probably told how clear it is about certain topics. For those who have ventured to read it, they've figured out 
            how drastically un-clear it really is. Understanding who the people in the Bible were, what the messages in the Bible
            were trying to say, and how it applies to us today is quite the undertaking. You could enroll in a college or university
            and get a degree in ancient near-east studies, or ancient Hebrew or Greek. That would at least get you started, but 
            that won't get you anywhere near halfway there... so keep going. Soon enough you can also become a biblical scholar and 
            maybe get a gig teaching at college or university. Good luck.
        </p>
        <p>Lucky for us, other people have already done that, and they are more than willing to share. Their insight provides the 
            much needed insight that we haven't ever really had on the Bible. That insight has been more than needed in today's 
            society. Especially as the self proclaimed preachers are exploding on social media telling us all how horrible we are. 
            The <strong>worst</strong> has been those using the Bible as a weapon against minority groups and the LGBTQIA+ society.
            The biblical scholars that you will find throughout this site provide a much needed peek into the reality of what the 
            Bible is, and what it is not; effectively, de-weaponizing the Bible.

        <h2>The Bible for Normal People</h2>
        <p>The Bible for Normal People community is the undertaking of Dr. Peter Enns and Jared Byas. Sarcastically self-pronounced 
            as "The only God-ordained podcast on the internet," they have worked to bring a world full of biblical scholarship into 
            the homes of everyday normal people. We don't all get an oppourtunity to attend the best universities for biblical studies, 
            and some of us are not very interested in the pay that comes with that career path, but we do have access to those who 
            have gone through those schools and disciplines, and we can get it whenever we want it.  
        </p>

        <p>Pete and Jared have come up with a few ways to get those scholars into your living room. The most popular is through 
            their podcast, which currently has 250 Episodes. The podcast doesn't form to any particular "religion," and tries to
            gather information from scholars across the gamut, including Jewish, Mulsim, and athiest scholars. They also have the 
            Bible for Normal People series; a series of books that dive into different biblical books. Doing so provides depth behind
            the stories we read in the Bible, and points out when we are reading allegory... which is a fancy way of saying "this 
            story shouldn't be taken literally."
        </p>
        <p>Pete and Jared have a slew of scholars that "spill the beans" on all of our favorite (not-so favorite) dogmas and biases.
            Follow these links to check out Pete and Jared on the Bible for Normal People podcast. Also, follow the other links provided
            for amazing information that you can use to better understand the Bible, and to better de-weaponize the oldes piece of 
            wisdom literature.

            Let's talk about the biblical elephant in the room. What does the Bible say about the LGBTQIA community? And, 
            what am I supposed to do about it? 
        </p>
        <figure id="img-div">

        </figure>
        <p>
            There's a few difficult ways to approach this topic, but let's start at the top. The Bible has been used in many
            ways to either attack those in the LGBTQIA community, or to justify turning those people away. The old "love the 
            sinner, hate the sin" line. Which is just a fancy way of saying "I love you, but I don't want to be around you."
            One of the best parts of the Biblical scholar movement is finding the truth. What would every single biblical scholar 
            on this and other pages say? Well, in less than five seconds they would say this: no matter what the 
            Bible says, or what we think it says, we can't use it to hurt other people.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If you or someone you love is part of the LGBTQIA community, it's important to know that there is support in the 
            Christian community, and it's not the kind that supports you from a distance. We are finally figuring out that there 
            never was any grounds to not include you in the community. Follow these links to find out more!
