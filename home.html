        <p class="first-paragraph">At some point, we all have to deal with the Bible. Whether it happens at home growing up, or later 
            in life when friends or coworkers bring it up, it rears its... Biblical head at some point. 
        </p>
        <p>We all know the premise, the Bible is God's inerrent word to all of us. It is clear and should be referred to as a 'how-to' 
            guide for life. Raising children? The answers are in the Bible. Trouble in the marriage? The Bible. Work issues? The Bible.
            Depression? The Bible. All roads seem to lead to the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>Some, myself included, have decided to take those roads. We crack open the Bible and read its perfect word. Except, it
            doesn't seem that perfect. In fact, it's rather confusing. Actually, it's kind of scary. What should I do with my troublesome 
        teenager? He won't listen. Deutoronmy says that the men "shall stone him with stones, that he die." (Deut 21:18) Capital punishment
    isn't new to us. The Bible had that for rape and murder. But also for unruly kids and breaking the Sabbath. Is that normal?  </p>

                “The spiritual disconnection many feel today stems precisely from expecting (or being told to expect) the Bible to be holy, perfect, and clear, when in fact after reading it they find it to be morally suspect, out of touch, confusing, and just plain weird.” -Pete Enns

        <p>Asking around isn't very helpful. In Exodus, we learn that God killed every first born in Egypt. Why? Because Pharoah was a 
            tool. Really? Kim, who lives down the street had to wake up to a dead husband and child because Pharoah was a jerk? That 
            doesn't seem fair, or good. Clergy (including your grandma) are quick to remind us that times were different. Circumstances 
            were different. Our understanding is very limited. And those are wonderful answers, that I put very neatly in my burn pile. 
            If that's what God does, that's not a God I want anything to do with. 
        </p>
        <p> Luckily, there are different answers. In fact, these answers don't come from clergy and grandma; they come from scholars. 
            People who have studied the Bible, and the people in the Bible, and their culture, and their language, and their neighbors, 
            and their neighbor's religion, and their neighbor's culture, etc., etc. The insight they provide allows us to look back and 
            say, yeah Pharoah was a jerk. But that doesn't mean God was a jerk too. We have to understand where these stories came from,
            why and how they made it into the Bible, and what exactly we can do with these stories today. 
        </p>
        <p>Whether you are an absolute believer, a doubter, an athiest, a believer in deconstruction, a believer in doubt or a faith 
            transition, getting answers is necessary. It's helpful. Putting the pieces of the puzzle together let's feel comfort as our 
            faith seems to keep us stranded in the storms. This page brings the newest and greatest of Biblical scholarship right into 
            our homes. We don't have to get an under-grad in ancient near-east studies to understand what is happening in the Bible. All 
            we have to do is have access to those who are breaking the cusp in Biblical understanding.
